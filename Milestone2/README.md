# MileStone 2 Cmpt 459
 Milestone 2 for Cmpt 459

## Instructions
command to run the program: 
- Install the following dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pickle, seaborn, matplotlib, lightgbm
- Please note that if you are using a Mac, there may be issues with using lightgbm. Please refer to the steps here: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/1369 or use a Linux machine instead. 
- Load a copy of the models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t6E33UoO6pa0ZClUF-wpv848JWPp7tQP?usp=sharing 
- `python3 main.py` from the ./src directory to run all steps

Please note that there is a longer runtime for sections 2.2 and 2.4 due to the training of multiple models. (i.e. Random Forests takes around 10 mins to train one model)
